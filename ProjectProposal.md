# Garf

Project Proposal

Trello User Story Tracker: https://trello.com/b/P1VFT2G3/garf
GitHub project: 

Name: **Garf**


Description:

Garf tracks pets anytime, anywhere making sure they are safe, close by, and out of harms way!

Problem Statement:

My sister's dog, Garf, is the inspiration behind the idea. Off the leash, Garf is liable to roam off trail in any direction for miles following his nose. Sometimes it's hard to know where he is. I know that other pet owners have the same problem because I receive multiple emails everyday from concerned neighbors looking for their pets.

Solution:

Garf tracks pets using a GPS collar and sends their real-time location to their owner(s) via a mobile application.

User Experience:

- Users create a profile and add a pet
- Users can edit their profile, add a pet, delete a pet, update a pet
- Users can tab to map page to see map with marker of pet location

Technologies:

React Native and Expo will be used on the front end. Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB will be used for the back end. Auth0 will be used for user authentication.  Raspberry Pi with LinuxOS and a GPS module will be used for the GPS device.
