Project: Build a GPS module dog collar and create a web app to track the real time location information



First step in the process was tinkering with different tehnologies to see what technologies I wanted to use. I just wanted to make sure this project was possible first.

Problems 11.4.18

Only 4 days away from  presenting, and I don't have a VIP. I did figure out how to parse and send the data on to a website where I can access it via a get request. This however is the main part of my project but not the real pizazz. Although I do feel blessed to have made it this far.



Key considerations:

- How to connect to your Raspberry Pi

1) VNC Viewer

2) SSH

- How to power your Pi (battery, charger)

- How to send data from Pi to remotely
